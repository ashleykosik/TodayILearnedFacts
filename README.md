This is my first App created with React by following the Udemy course: Crash Course: Build a Full-Stack Web App in a Weekend!
Starting with HTML, then CSS I learned a lot about flexbox and grid, 
Javascript, then used React for the first time breaking down the layout into components - header, sidebar, alls facts, and each fact

Today I Learned is a peer based fact checking app.
Facts are generated from users with the 'Share A Fact' button toggling the visibility of a form that requires less than 200 characters of text, a url, & category selection. After creation, new facts are placed at the top of the list. Upon reload facts are listed in order of most liked.
The sidebar buttons filter facts by category
Eact fact can be liked, market mindblowing, or be marked untrue with the red circle. If any statement has more untrue votes than mindblowing and like the [DISPUTED] text will be displayed.
Each fact is created with a timestamp and stored in supabase which is also functioning as the back end API handling the requests.

Technology used:
jsx the language of React

Future of this app: There is no plan to release this app or keep the supabase database running. Data will be saved in data.js
